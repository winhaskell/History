What is Lisp?

Lisp is a family of programming languages descended from a language John McCarthy invented (or more accurately, discovered) in
the late 1950s. The two main dialects now are Common Lisp and Scheme. We're working on a new dialect called Arc.

How can I learn Lisp?

The way to learn any language is to write programs in it. You have two main dialects to choose between: Scheme and Common Lisp. 
They each have advantages and disadvantages, but the differences between them are tiny compared to the differences between them 
and other languages, so if you want to start learning Lisp, it doesn't matter which you choose.

There are good books about both dialects, and many good free implementations. So get a book and an implementation, and start 
trying to write programs. Read existing source code to get an idea of Lisp style. If you run into trouble, ask on comp.lang.lisp. 
People there are always willing to help newbies.

Which should I learn, Common Lisp or Scheme? What's the difference?

Common Lisp is powerful but ugly. Scheme is small and clean, but the standard only defines the inner core of the language. 
If I had to deliver an application I'd probably use Common Lisp; if I were teaching a course I might use Scheme 
(but with Common Lisp macros).
