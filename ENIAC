ENIAC
In 1942, physicist John Mauchly proposed an all-electronic calculating machine. The U.S. Army, meanwhile, 
needed to calculate complex wartime ballistics tables. Proposal met patron.

The result was ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer), built between 1943 and 1945â€”the first large-scale computer 
to run at electronic speed without being slowed by any mechanical parts. For a decade, until a 1955 lightning strike, 
ENIAC may have run more calculations than all mankind had done up to that point.
